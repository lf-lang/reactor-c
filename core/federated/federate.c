 * such outputs, then send next event tag (NET), which will give the tag of
 * the earliest event on the event queue, or, if the queue is empty, the timeout
 * time, or, if there is no timeout, FOREVER.
 *
 * A NET or TAN is a promise saying that, absent network inputs, this federate will
 * not produce an output message with tag earlier than the NET value or (TAN,0).
 *
 * If there are upstream federates, then after sending a NET, this will block
 * until either the RTI grants the advance to the requested time or the wait
 * for the response from the RTI is interrupted by a change in the event queue
 * (e.g., a physical action triggered or a network message arrived).
 * If there are no upstream federates, then it will not wait for a TAG
 * (which won't be forthcoming anyway) and returns the earliest tag on the event queue.
 *
 * If the federate has neither upstream nor downstream federates, then this
 * returns the specified tag immediately without sending anything to the RTI.
 *
 * If there is at least one physical action somewhere in the federate that
 * can trigger an output to a downstream federate, then the NET is required
 * to be less than the current physical time. If physical time is less than
 * the earliest event in the event queue (or the event queue is empty), then
 * this function will send a Time Advance Notice (TAN) message instead of NET.
 * That message does not require a response from the RTI. The TAN message will
 * be sent repeatedly as physical time advances with the time interval between
 * messages controlled by the target parameter
 * coordination-options: {advance-message-interval timevalue}.
 * It will switch back to sending a NET message if and when its event queue
 * has an event with a timestamp less than physical time.
 *
 * If wait_for_reply is false, then this function will simply send the
 * specified tag and return that tag immediately. This is useful when a
 * federate is shutting down and will not be sending any more messages at all.
 *
 * In all cases, this returns either the specified tag or
 * another tag when it is safe to advance logical time to the returned tag.
 * The returned tag may be less than the specified tag if there are upstream
 * federates and either the RTI responds with a lesser tag or
 * the wait for a response from the RTI is interrupted by a
 * change in the event queue.
 *
 * This function is used in centralized coordination only.
 *
 * This function assumes the caller holds the mutex lock.
 *
 * @param tag The tag.
