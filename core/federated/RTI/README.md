This folder contains the source code for the Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI) that
is necessary for federated Lingua Franca programs. To compile and install, do:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
```

To run the unit tests
```bash
make test
```

**Note:** To enable DEBUG messages, use the following build commands instead:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ../
make
sudo make install
```

If you would like to go back to the non-DEBUG mode, you would have to remove all contents of the `build` folder.

**Note:** To enable simple HMAC-based authentication of federates,
add `-DAUTH=ON` option to the cmake command as shown below:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DAUTH=ON ../
make
sudo make install
```

If you would like to go back to non-AUTH mode, you would have to remove all contents of the `build` folder.

To build a docker image for the RTI, do 
```bash
docker build -t lflang/rti:latest -f rti.Dockerfile ../../../
```

To push it to DockerHub, run:
```bash
docker push lflang/rti:latest
```

You may need to login first:
```bash
docker login -u [username]
```

To authenticate, request a PAT on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security).
