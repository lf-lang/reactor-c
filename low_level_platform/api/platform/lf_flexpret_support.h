 * For example, a mutex might be defined for the GPIOTE peripheral interrupt number
 *
 * When initialized, the interrupt is inserted into a global linked list
 * for disabling and enabling all interrupts during sleep functions.
 * - All interrupts are disabled by default after initialization
 * - Priority levels are restricted between (0-7)
