 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Undefining the macros in the api/set.h
 * Refer to api/set.h for details of the macros
 *
 * Note for target language developers. This is one way of developing a target language where
 * the C core runtime is adopted. This file is a translation layer that implements Lingua Franca
 * APIs which interact with the internal _lf_SET and _lf_schedule APIs. This file can act as a
 * template for future runtime developement for target languages.
 * For source generation, see xtext/org.icyphy.linguafranca/src/org/icyphy/generator/CCppGenerator.xtend.
