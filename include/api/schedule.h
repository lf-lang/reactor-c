 *
 * Most of these functions take a `void*` pointer to an action, which will be internally cast to
 * a `lf_action_base_t*` pointer. The cast could be done by macros in reaction_macros.h, but unlike
 * the macros defined there, it is common for `lf_schedule` functions to be invoked outside of reaction
 * bodies.  This means that users writing code in separate library files are responsible for ensuring that
 * the `void*` pointer is indeed a valid `lf_action_base_t*` pointer before passing it to `lf_schedule`.
 * The compiler will not check this.

/**
 * @brief Schedule the specified action at a later tag with the specified token as a payload.
 * @ingroup API
 *
 * The later tag will depend on whether the action is logical or physical. If it is logical,
 * the time of the event will be the current logical time of the environment associated with
 * the action plus the minimum delay of the action plus the extra delay. If that time is equal
 * to the current time, then the tag will be one microstep beyond the current tag.
 * If the action is physical, the time will be the current physical time plus the extra delay,
 * and the microstep will be zero.
 *
 * In both cases, if the resulting tag of the event conincides with a previously scheduled event
 * for the same action, then, by default, a microstep will be added to the tag until there is no
 * colliding event. This behavior can be changed by specifying a minimum spacing and a policy,
 * as explained below.
 *
 * An action will trigger at a logical time that depends on the `extra_delay` argument given to
 * this schedule function, the `<min_delay>`, `<min_spacing>`, and `<policy>` arguments in the
 * action declaration, and whether the action is physical or logical.
 *
 * For a `logical` action `a`, the tag assigned to the event is computed as follows.
 * First, let _t_ be the _current logical time_. For a logical action, _t_ is just the logical
 * time at which the reaction calling `schedule()` is called. The **preliminary time** of the
 * action is then just _t_ + `<min_delay>` + `<offset>`. This preliminary time may be further
 * modified, as explained below.
 *
 * For a **physical** action, the preliminary time is similar, except that _t_ is replaced by
 * the current _physical_ time _T_ when `schedule()` is called.
 *
 * If no `<min_spacing>` has been declared, then the tag of the event is simply the preliminary time
 * unless there is already an event scheduled for the same action with the same tag.
 * In that case, a microstep is added to the tag. If there is again a previously scheduled
 * event with the same tag, then a microstep is added to the tag again.
 * This process is repeated until there is no previously scheduled event with the same tag.
 *
 * If a `<min_spacing>` has been declared, then it gives a minimum logical time
 * interval between the tags of two subsequently scheduled events. The first effect this
 * has is that events will have monotically increasing tags. The difference between the
 * times of two successive tags is at least `<min_spacing>`. If the
 * preliminary time is closer than `<min_spacing>` to the time of the previously
 * scheduled event (if there is one), or if the preliminary time is earlier than
 * the previously scheduled event, then the time will be modified to enforce
 * the minimum spacing. The `<policy>` argument  determines how the minimum spacing
 * constraint is enforced.
 *
 * Note that "previously scheduled" here means specifically the tag resulting from
 * the most recent call to the schedule function for the same action.
 *
 * A `<min_spacing>` of 0 is not quite the same as no `<min_spacing>` declared.
 * With a `<min_spacing>` of 0, events will still have monotically increasing tags,
 * but the difference between the times of two successive tags can be 0.
 *
 * The `<policy>` is one of the following:
 *
 * - `"defer"`: (**the default**) The event is added to the event queue with a tag that is
 *    equal to earliest time that satisfies the minimal spacing requirement. Assuming the
 *    time of the preceding event is _t_prev_, then the tag of the new event simply becomes
 *    _t_prev_ + `<min_spacing>`.
 * - `"drop"`: The new event is dropped and `schedule()` returns without having modified the event queue.
 * - `"replace"`: The payload (if any) of the new event is assigned to the preceding event
 *     if it is still pending in the event queue; no new event is added to the event queue
 *     in this case. If the preceding event has already been pulled from the event queue,
 *     the default `"defer"` policy is applied.
 *
 * Note that while the `"defer"` policy is conservative in the sense that it does not discard events,
 * it could potentially cause an unbounded growth of the event queue.
 *
 * For example, suppose the minimum spacing of a logical action is 10 ms and the policy is `"defer"`.
 * Suppose that in a reaction to `startup`, the logical action is scheduled with a delay of
 * 100 ms, then again with a delay of 99 ms, and a third time with a delay of 101 ms.
 * The logical action will trigger at elapsed times 100 ms, 110 ms, and 120 ms.
 *
 * There are three conditions under which this function will not
 * actually put an event on the event queue and decrement the reference count
 * of the token (if there is one), which could result in the payload being
 * freed. In all three cases, this function returns 0. Otherwise,
 * it returns a handle to the scheduled trigger, which is an integer
 * greater than 0.
 *
 * The first condition is that stop() has been called and the time offset
 * of this event is greater than zero.
 * The second condition is that the logical time of the event
 * is greater that the stop time (timeout) that is specified in the target
 * properties or on the command line.
 * The third condition is that the trigger argument is null.
 *
