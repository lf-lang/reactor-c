 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Target-specific runtime functions for the C target language.
 * This API layer can be used in conjunction with:
 *     target C;
 * 
 * Note for target language developers. This is one way of developing a target language where 
 * the C core runtime is adopted. This file is a translation layer that implements Lingua Franca 
 * APIs which interact with the internal _lf_SET and _lf_schedule APIs. This file can act as a 
 * template for future runtime developement for target languages.
 * For source generation, see xtext/org.icyphy.linguafranca/src/org/icyphy/generator/CCppGenerator.xtend.

/////////////  SET Functions (to produce an output)

// NOTE: According to the "Swallowing the Semicolon" section on this page:
//    https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0.1/cpp_3.html
// the following macros should use an odd do-while construct to avoid
// problems with if ... else statements that do not use braces around the
// two branches.

/**
 * Set the specified output (or input of a contained reactor)
 * to the specified value.
 *
 * If the value argument is a primitive type such as int,
 * double, etc. as well as the built-in types bool and string, 
 * the value is copied and therefore the variable carrying the
 * value can be subsequently modified without changing the output.
 * This also applies to structs with a type defined by a typedef
 * so that the type designating string does not end in '*'.
 * 
 * If the value argument is a pointer
 * to memory that the calling reaction has dynamically allocated,
 * the memory will be automatically freed once all downstream
 * reactions no longer need the value.
 * If 'lf_set_destructor' is called on 'out', then that destructor
 * will be used to free 'value'. 
 * Otherwise, the default void free(void*) function is used.
 * 
 * @param out The output port (by name) or input of a contained
 *  reactor in form input_name.port_name.
 * @param value The value to insert into the self struct.
