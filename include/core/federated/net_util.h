 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Header file for network utility functions for Lingua Franca programs.
 * Note that these functions do not acquire any mutexes. To use them,
 * you must ensure either that only one thread ever sends on each socket
 * and one thread receives on each socket (these two can be the same thread)
 * or that the caller handles mutual exclusion to prevent more than one thread
 * from accessing the socket at a time.
