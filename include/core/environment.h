 * @section DESCRIPTION API for creating and destroying environments. An environment is the
 * "context" within which the reactors are executed. The environment contains data structures
 * which are shared among the reactors such as priority queues, the current logical tag, 
 * the worker scheduler, and a lot of meta data. Each reactor stores a pointer to its
 * environment on its self-struct. If a LF program has multiple scheduling enclaves,
 * then each enclave will have its own environment.

 * @brief The global environment.
 * Some operations are not specific to a particular scheduling enclave and therefore
 * have no associated environment. When invoking a function such as lf_critical_section_enter,
 * which requires an environment argument, it may be possible to pass this GLOBAL_ENVIRONMENT.
 * For lf_critical_section_enter, for example, this may acquire a global mutex instead of
 * a mutex specific to a particular scheduling enclave. Most functions that take environment
 * arguments, however, cannot accept the GLOBAL_ENVIRONMENT argument, and passing it will
 * result in an assertion violation.
