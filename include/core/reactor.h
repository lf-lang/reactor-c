 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Header file for the infrastructure for the C target of Lingua Franca.
 * This file contains header information used by both the threaded and
 * non-threaded versions of the C runtime.
 *
 * This header file defines the functions and macros that programmers use
 * in the body of reactions for reading and writing inputs and outputs and
 * scheduling future events. The LF compiler does not parse that C code.
 * This fact strongly affects the design.
 *
 * The intent of the C target for Lingua Franca not to provide a safe
 * programming environment (The C++ and TypeScript targets are better
 * choices for that), but rather to find the lowest possible overhead
 * implementation of Lingua Franca. The API herein can easily be misused,
 * leading to memory leaks, nondeterminism, or program crashes.

 *
 * logical action: A logical action has an offset (default is zero)
 * and a minimum interarrival time (MIT), which also defaults to zero.
 * The logical time at which this scheduled event will trigger is
 * the current time plus the offset plus the delay argument given to
 * this function. If, however, that time is not greater than a prior
 * triggering of this logical action by at least the MIT, then the
 * one of two things can happen depending on the policy specified
 * for the action. If the action's policy is DROP (default), then the
 * action is simply dropped and the memory pointed to by value argument
 * is freed. If the policy is DEFER, then the time will be increased
 * to equal the time of the most recent triggering plus the MIT.
 *
 * For the above, "current time" means the logical time of the
 * reaction that is calling this function. Logical actions should
 * always be scheduled within a reaction invocation, never asynchronously
 * from the outside. FIXME: This needs to be checked.

 * were a logical action.

 * actually put an event on the event queue and decrement the reference count
 * of the token (if there is one), which could result in the payload being
 * freed. In all three cases, this function returns 0. Otherwise,
 * it returns a handle to the scheduled trigger, which is an integer
 * greater than 0.
 *
 * The first condition is that stop() has been called and the time offset
 * of this event is greater than zero.
