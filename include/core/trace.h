 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Definitions of tracepoint events for use with the C code generator and any other
 * code generator that uses the C infrastructure (such as the Python code generator).
 *
 * See: https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Tracing#TracingInC
 *
 * The trace file is named trace.lft and is a binary file with the following format:
 *
 * Header:
 * * instant_t: The start time. This is both the starting physical time and the starting logical time.
 * * int: Size N of the table mapping pointers to descriptions.
 * This is followed by N records each of which has:
 * * A pointer value (the key).
 * * A null-terminated string (the description).
 *
 * Traces:
 * A sequence of traces, each of which begins with an int giving the length of the trace
 * followed by binary representations of the trace_record struct written using fwrite().
