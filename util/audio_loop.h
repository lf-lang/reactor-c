 * @brief Utility function for playing audio on Linux or MacOS.
 *
 * Audio functions for Linux or MacOS. To start an audio loop, call
 * `lf_start_audio_loop()`, passing it the logical time at which
 * you would like the loop to start.  To play a waveform,
 * call `lf_play_audio_waveform()`.  A waveform may be
 * synthesized or read from a .wav file using
 * `read_wave_file()` (see wave_file_reader.h).
 *
 * To use this, include the following in your target properties:
 * <pre>
    files: [
        "/lib/c/reactor-c/util/audio_loop_mac.c",
        "/lib/c/reactor-c/util/audio_loop.h",
        "/lib/c/reactor-c/util/audio_loop_linux.c",
    ],
    cmake-include: [
        "/lib/c/reactor-c/util/audio_loop.cmake"
    ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * In addition, you need this in your Lingua Franca file:
 * <pre>
 * preamble {=
 *     #include "audio_loop.h"
 * =}
 * </pre>
