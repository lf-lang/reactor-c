 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Audio functions for Linux. To start an audio loop, call
 * `lf_start_audio_loop`, passing it the logical time at which
 * you would like the loop to start.  To play a waveform,
 * call `lf_play_audio_waveform()`.  A waveform may be
 * synthesized or read from a .wav file using
 * `read_wave_file()` (see wave_file_reader.h).
 *
 * To use this, include the following flags in your target properties:
 * If you are running on Linux:
 * <pre>
 * target C {
 *     flags: "-lasound -lm",
 *     files: ["/lib/C/util/audio_loop_linux.c", "/lib/C/util/audio_loop.h"]
 * };
 * </pre>
 * If you are running on Mac:
 * <pre>
 * target C {
 *     flags: "-framework AudioToolbox -framework CoreFoundation -lm",
 *     files: ["/lib/C/util/audio_loop_mac.c", "/lib/C/util/audio_loop.h"]
 * };
 * </pre>
 *
 * In addition, you need this in your Lingua Franca file:
 * If you are running on Linux:
 * <pre>
 * preamble {=
 *     #include "audio_loop_linux.c"
 * =}
 * </pre>
 * If you are running on Mac:
 * <pre>
 * preamble {=
 *     #include "audio_loop_mac.c"
 * =}
 * </pre>
