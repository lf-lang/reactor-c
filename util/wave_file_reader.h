 * @brief Utility function for reading WAV audio files.
 *
 * This defines functions and data types for importing audio files with the
 * wave audio format. The main function is read_wave_file(), which, given
 * a path to a .wav file, reads the file and, if the format of the file is
 * supported, returns an lf_waveform_t struct, which contains the raw
 * audio data in 16-bit linear PCM form.
 *
 * This code has few dependencies, so it should run on just about any platform.
 *
 * To use this, include the following flags in your target properties:
 * <pre>
target C {
    files: [
        "/lib/c/reactor-c/util/wave_file_reader.c",
        "/lib/c/reactor-c/util/wave_file_reader.h"
    ],
    cmake-include: [
        "/lib/c/reactor-c/util/wave_file_reader.cmake"
    ]
}
 * </pre>
 *
 * In addition, you need this in your Lingua Franca file or reactor:
 * <pre>
 * preamble {=
 *     #include "wave_file_reader.h"
 * =}
 * </pre>

 * This implementation supports only 16-bit linear PCM files.
