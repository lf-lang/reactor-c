 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * This file provides macro `DO_CONVERT(fromType, toType, value)`
 * Sometimes the generic Reactor can work as a connector between two reactors
 * We provide this macro to enable user to provide their own converter libraries
 * as long as they follow the convention for naming their conversion functions this macro will work
 *
 * Convention: toType convert__fromType_to__toType(fromType x)
